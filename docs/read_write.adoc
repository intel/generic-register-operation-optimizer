== Reading and writing

=== Read and write specifications

If a group is combined with paths _without_ values, the result is a `read_spec`.
If a group is combined with paths _with_ values, the result is a `write_spec`.

A `read_spec` is an empty object which carries in its type all the information
necessary for a read. A `write_spec` is an object carrying similar type
information, but also with register data in the correct layout, ready for writing.

[source,cpp]
----
// this does no runtime work, just composing types
auto r_spec = grp / "reg"_r;

// this packs values into register layouts
auto w_spec = grp / ("reg"_r = 42);
----

NOTE: If any bound paths are not resolvable or are ambiguous in the group, a
compile-time error is produced.

A `write_spec` supports indexing, for retrieving or updating values.

[source,cpp]
----
auto w_spec = grp / ("reg"_r = 42);
w_spec["reg"_r] = 17;          // update value
assert(w_spec["reg"_r] == 17); // retrieve value
----

Updates are not limited to reassignment; `operator[]` returns a proxy object
with all the compound assignment operators defined on it, as well as increment
and decrement operators.

A `write_spec` may be indexed with any path that is resolvable by a bound path.

[source,cpp]
----
auto w_spec = grp / ("reg"_r = 42); // "reg" is bound
w_spec["reg.field"_f] = 1;          // OK, assuming "reg" contains "field"
----

As a short cut, if only one value is specified, a `write_spec` can implicitly
convert to that value. Note that this is read-only; the converted value is not a
reference that can be used for update.

[source,cpp]
----
auto w_spec = grp / ("reg"_r = 42);
assert(w_spec == 42); // implicit conversion
----

=== Read

The `read` function takes a `read_spec` and produces a
https://intel.github.io/cpp-baremetal-senders-and-receivers/[sender].

[source,cpp]
----
auto r = groov::read(grp / "reg"_r);
----

It does this by:

 - computing a mask for each register that is read, according to the fields
 - for each register, calling `read` on the bus with the address and mask
 - executing `when_all` on the resulting senders
 - turning the results into a `write_spec`

Read can also be piped in a chain of senders.

[source,cpp]
----
auto r = async::just(grp / "reg"_r) | groov::read() | async::sync_wait();
----

To do a simple read from a bus that is synchronous (e.g. an MMIO bus),
`sync_read` may be called:

[source,cpp]
----
auto r = async::just(grp / "reg"_r) | groov::sync_read();
----

NOTE: `sync_read` automatically assumes that the operation will succeed and
returns the resulting `write_spec`.

=== Write

The `write` function takes a `write_spec` and produces a
https://intel.github.io/cpp-baremetal-senders-and-receivers/[sender].

[source,cpp]
----
auto r = groov::write(grp("reg"_r = 42));
----

It does this by:

 - computing masks and identity values for each register that is written, according to the fields
 - for each register, calling `write` on the bus with the address, masks and value
 - executing `when_all` on the resulting senders

Write can also be piped in a chain of senders.

[source,cpp]
----
auto r = async::just(grp("reg"_r = 42)) | groov::write() | async::sync_wait();
----

To do a simple write to a bus that is synchronous (e.g. an MMIO bus),
`sync_write` may be called:

[source,cpp]
----
auto r = async::just(grp("reg"_r = 42)) | groov::sync_write();
----

The return value here is as for
https://intel.github.io/cpp-baremetal-senders-and-receivers/#_sync_wait[`async::sync_wait`]:
a `std::optional<stdx::tuple<T>>` where `T` is whatever is sent by the bus
`write` function. A disengaged optional means that the write completed with an
error (although this should not happen for an MMIO write).

Because `read` sends a `write_spec`, a read-modify-write can be achieved with
piping:

[source,cpp]
----
async::just(grp / "reg"_r)
    | groov::read()
    | async::then(
      [](auto spec) { spec["reg"_r] ^= 0xffff'ffff;
                      return spec; })
    | groov::write()
    | async::sync_wait();
----

=== Buses

`groov` is a library for orchestrating and managing read and write operations
efficiently, but it can't actually perform the reads and writes to hardware.
That's what a bus is for. A bus is `groov`â€‹'s interface with lower levels and it
is used by `read` and `write`. So it has its own `read` and `write` API.

[source,cpp]
----
struct bus {
  template <stdx::ct_string RegisterName, auto Mask>
  static auto read(auto addr) -> async::sender auto;

  template <stdx::ct_string RegisterName, auto Mask, auto IdMask, auto IdValue>
  static auto write(auto addr, auto value) -> async::sender auto;
};
----

To provide for asynchronous behaviour, a bus's `read` and `write` functions
return senders. These can of course be `async::just_result_of` senders in the
case of a synchronous operation like memory-mapped IO.

Both `read` and `write` operations receive a compile-time mask of what is being
read or written, so that they can optimize best according to hardware
capabilities. For `write`, bits set in `Mask` are the bits that must be written,
and bits set in `IdMask` _may_ be safely written using the corresponding bits in
`IdValue`.

NOTE: `Mask` and `IdMask` are disjoint sets of bits. Therefore `Idvalue` and
`value` are also disjoint sets of bits. Bits that are zero in `IdMask` are also
zero in `IdValue`.
